"""GARUDA - ML brain (AppSail | Python/FastAPI).

Phase 1: hello-world health endpoints that prove the AppSail compute surface
deploys and binds the Catalyst-injected listen port. The heavy ML engines
(entity resolution, MO clustering, co-offender network, forecasting, anomaly,
copilot) arrive in Phases 4-7 under app/engines and app/routers.

Start command (see app-config.json):
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${X_ZOHO_CATALYST_LISTEN_PORT}
